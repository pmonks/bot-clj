# Clojure bot

A small [Symphony](http://www.symphony.com/) bot that attempts to execute messages sent to it as Clojure code,
in a secure sandbox.  Heavily inspired by [verma/clj-slackbot](https://github.com/verma/clj-slackbot).

## Installation

For now Clojure bot is available in source form only, so fire up your favourite git client and get cloning!

## Configuration

Clojure bot is configured via a single, optional [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) file that may be specified on the
command line via the "-c" command line option.  You can also provide a "-h" command line option to get help on all of the
command line options the bot supports.

### Configuration File Location and Loading Mechanism

The configuration file is traditionally called `config.edn` (but may be called anything you like) and may be stored anywhere
that can be read by the bot's JVM process via standard POSIX file I/O.  It's loaded using the [aero](https://github.com/juxt/aero)
library - see the [aero documentation](https://github.com/juxt/aero/blob/master/README.md) for details on the various advanced
options aero supports.

The bot ships with a [default `config.edn` file](https://github.com/pmonks/bot-clj/blob/master/resources/config.edn)
that will be read if a config file is not specified on the command line.  This file delegates basically all configuration to
environment variables, allowing the administrator to deploy and run the bot as a standalone uberjar, and configure it exclusively
from the runtime environment.

Please refer to the [default `config.edn` file](https://github.com/pmonks/bot-clj/blob/master/resources/config.edn)
for details on using these environment variables.  Their use is not described here.

### A Note on Security

**The bot's configuration includes sensitive information (certificate locations and passwords), so please be extra careful
to secure this configuration, however you choose to manage it (in a file, environment variables, etc.).**

### Configuration File Format

The configuration file is structured as follows:

```edn
{
  :symphony-coords {
    :pod-id           "<id of pod to connect to - will autopopulate whichever of the 4 URLs aren't provided. (optional - see below)>"
    :session-auth-url "<the URL of the session authentication endpoint. (optional - see below)>"
    :key-auth-url     "<The URL of the key authentication endpoint. (optional - see below)>"
    :agent-api-url    "<The URL of the agent API. (optional - see below)>"
    :pod-api-url      "<The URL of the Pod API. (optional - see below)>"
    :trust-store      ["<path to Java truststore>"        "<password of truststore>"]
    :user-cert        ["<path to bot user's certificate>" "<password of bot user's certificate>"]
    :user-email       "<bot user's email address>"
  }
  :jolokia-config {
    "host" "<jolokia-server-host>"
    "port" "<jolokia-server-port-as-a-string>"
  }
  :evaluation-timeout <seconds>    ; Optional - defaults to 10 seconds
  :accept-connections-interval <minutes>    ; Optional - defaults to 30 minutes
  :admin-emails ["user1@domain.tld" "user2@domain.tld"]    ; Optional
}
```

#### :symphony-coords

The coordinates of the various endpoints, certificates, knickknacks and geegaws that the bot needs in order to connect to a
Symphony pod.  This map is passed directly to the
[clj-symphony library's `connect` function](https://symphonyoss.github.io/clj-symphony/clj-symphony.connect.html#var-connect),
and has the same semantics as what's described there.

#### :jolokia-config

The configuration of the [Jolokia](https://jolokia.org/) library, used to support server-side ops monitoring of the bot.
This map is passed directly to Jolokia's [`JolokiaServerConfig` constructor](https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/blob/master/agent/jvm/src/main/java/org/jolokia/jvmagent/JolokiaServerConfig.java#L92).
See the [default Jolokia property file](https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/blob/master/agent/jvm/src/main/resources/default-jolokia-agent.properties)
for a full list of the supported configuration options and their default values, and note that all
keys and values in this map MUST be strings (this is a Jolokia requirement).

#### :evaluation-timeout

Timeout (in seconds) for evaluating Clojure forms.  Optional and defaults to 10 seconds.

#### :accept-connections-interval

The interval (in minutes) that the bot will use to check for and accept incoming cross-pod connection requests.  If not
specified, defaults to 30 minutes.

#### :admin-emails

A list of administrator email addresses.  These users will be able to interact with the bot via ChatOps (1:1 chats with the bot
in Symphony).  Administrators should say `help` to the bot to get a list of the available admin commands.

### Java Security Configuration

This bot leverages the [clojails](https://github.com/Raynes/clojail) Clojure sandboxing library, which in turn leverages
[Java's security manager capability](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/index.html).  Because the
Java security manager mechanism is JVM-global, you **must** provide a Java security policy file in the startup parameters for
the bot's JVM, or else it will fail with numerous `java.security.AccessControlException: access denied` exceptions.

Note that the policy file you provide only applies to code running *outside* the clojail sandbox (the bot's own code).  For this
reason the [sample policy file](https://github.com/pmonks/bot-clj/blob/master/.java.policy.sample) is deliberately lenient - this
is the simplest way to ensure that all of the bot's code is allowed to function.

With that said, while clojail is well tested, there is always the possibility that code submitted to it will escape the sandbox.
For this reason, in production environments it is recommended that the global policy file is carefully constructed, to provide
defence in depth.

Contributions of stronger policy files that don't interfere with the operation of the bot would be very welcome!

### Logging Configuration

Clojure bot uses the [logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) library for logging, and ships with a
[reasonable default `logback.xml` file](https://github.com/pmonks/bot-clj/blob/master/resources/logback.xml).
Please review the [logback documentation](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html#configFileProperty) if you
wish to override this default logging configuration.

## Usage

For now, you can run Clojure bot either directly or as a Docker image.

### Direct Execution

```
$ lein git-info-edn
$ lein run -- -c <path to EDN configuration file>
```

or

```
$ lein do git-info-edn, uberjar
...
$ java -jar ./target/bot-clj-standalone.jar -c <path to EDN configuration file>
```

### Dockerised Execution

To build the container:

```
$ docker build -t bot-clj .
```

To run the container:

```
$ # Interactively:
$ docker run -v /path/to/config/directory:/etc/opt/bot-clj:ro bot-clj
$ # In the background:
$ docker run -d -v /path/to/config/directory:/etc/opt/bot-clj:ro bot-clj
```

Where `/path/to/config/directory` should be replaced with the fully qualified path of the configuration directory
_on the Docker host_.  This configuration directory must contain:

 1. the service account certificate and truststore that the bot should use
 2. a `config.edn` file (in the format described above), that points to the certificates using `/etc/opt/bot-clj` as the base path (that's where the configuration folder is mounted _within_ the container)

 And it may optionally also contain:
 1. blacklist files (see above for details)
 2. a logback configuration file

You can also use Docker Compose, by running:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

This assumes that the `etc` directory contains the certificate, truststore, and `config.edn` file, as described above.

### Branching Structure

This project has two permanent branches called `master` and `dev`.  `master` is a
[GitHub protected branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) and cannot be pushed to directly -
all pushes (from project team members) and pull requests (from the wider community) must be made against the `dev`
branch.  The project team will periodically merge outstanding changes from `dev` to `master`.

All commits to the `dev` branch automatically trigger redeployment of the instance of the bot that's configured to run against the
[Foundation's Open Developer Platform (ODP)](https://symphonyoss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FM/pages/37847084/Open+Developer+Platform).
All commits to the `master` branch automatically trigger redeployment of the instance of the bot that's configured to run
against [the Foundation's production pod](https://foundation.symphony.com/).
